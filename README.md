This web app will administer the experiments for a research study comparing a variety of text presentation methods on small screens, such as smart watches.

The server is a Node.js script with dependencies [Mongoose]. Once you have downloaded the code, you must run `npm install` from within the `app` directory.

The server code is `app.js`. Start it with Node, then open two browser windows at `localhost:3000/`, and you can start to use the app.
As supplied, the server will use a database hosted at MongoLab.
