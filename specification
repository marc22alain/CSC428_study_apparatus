FUNCTIONS:
Server:
	-manage the experiments
	-serve up the texts
	-record the test results

Client - reader:
	-present the texts in three different ways:
		.full page
		.RSVP optimized per literature
		.Spritz per API

Client - writer/tester:
	-present multiple choice question(s) testing comprehension of the texts
	-offer writing interface for responding to the texts

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set of experiments:
	-pseudo-random distribution of texts to presentation methods, ensuring even and complete coverage of every text in every experiment

Experiment:
	-set of texts
	-order of presentation
	-presentation is 2 texts per method
	-results recorded from tests (2+ per text)
		.answers
		.response times

Text:
	-tweet with some metadata and hashtags
	-multiple choice question(s) about the content
		.Q: does the order of presentation of the answers get randomized? Yes
	-probably 12
	-1 MongoDB record with the various attributes
	 {
	 	tweet: {
	 		text: String,
	 		author: String,
	 		date: String,
	 		hashtags: [tag: String]
	 	}
	 	test: {
	 		question: String,
	 		correct_answer: String,
	 		incorrect_answers: [answer: String]
	 	}
	 }

Participants:
	-person meeting some conditions (control variables)
	-particular experiment that they took
	-their responses to the tests
